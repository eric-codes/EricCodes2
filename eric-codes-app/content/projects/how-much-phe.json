How Much Phe is a service that allows their end users to search for foods and retrieve their amino acid content, save food listings, track their amino acid consumption and calculate exactly what they need to eat each day to fulfill their amino acid needs.",

        "solution": "I understood the main demographic of the app were mothers and possibly children, so I had to come up with a typographic treatment and color choices that would aesthetically appeal to that demographic. In addition, the user flow had to be intuitive, calculator functions had to be easily accessible and the app as a whole had to be painless for the end users to use.",

I went with Source Sans Pro as a type choice because of itâ€™s fantastic on-screen readability and friendly, but serious character. I also created a visual identity for this app, choosing a tall but friendly typeface for the logotype treatment. For the graphic identity, I simplified the chemical model for the phenylalanine amino acid into a circular icon that renders well on all device sizes. Much of the final design work was flat, clean vector imagery that makes things easy to find, with a clean, polished feel."
