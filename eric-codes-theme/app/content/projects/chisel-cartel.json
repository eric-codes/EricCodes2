        "blurb": "I designed and developed a web app for Chisel Cartel that allowed users to vote and view battles. The system is currently in it’s infancy, but it’s set up in such a way that allows it to be scalable. Currently, the system can track votes based on cookies and IP, in a one-versus-one system that will pull random votes out of a pool of entries and allow users to vote until all pairs have been voted. The entire site runs on a WordPress back-end with a custom-built AngularJS theme that works with the WP REST API in order to manage data.",

        "problem": "Chisel Cartel was started as a concept for the graffiti subculture. In graffiti culture, the roots of the letterforms and the entire concept of graffiti itself is based around competition - graffiti writers would battle each other in an effort to outdo each other’s style and create artwork that pushed boundaries. Chisel Cartel was a way to bring this tradition into the digital age, and they wanted to create a digital system where writers could battle and win by popular vote to win cash prizes.",

Because the emphasis of the website is so heavy on letterforms, and the images would make up the splashes of occasional color on the site, I opted for a dark monochrome layout, with splashes of red for a CTA color and spot treatment. The fonts were chosen to be clean and modern, in order to juxtapose a sense of modern technological design sensibility against the often dirty, wild and organic feel of the calligraphy."
